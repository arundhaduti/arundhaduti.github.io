Software engineer based in India, building **Agentic AI systems** and **Automation-first products**.  
I started my career in quality engineering and today I use that same rigor to build **production‑grade AI agents** instead of demo bots.

I love board games, algorithmic thinking, and building things that actually ship.

- Developing a **production‑grade Dental Appointment Booking AI Agent** (not a chatbot — a real system)
- Designing **AI‑driven test automation** and **LLM‑powered API testing frameworks**
- Writing about **agentic systems, AI engineering, and software quality** on my GitHub Pages blog and Medium
